# Test-Vagrant-Assignment
In the main branch of the repository README and .gitignore files are available.
In the master branch of the repository, Project folder are available.
In src/main/java two POM classes are created.
One for fetching data from the IMDB site
Another is for fetching data from the Wikipedia site.
In src/test/java Test classes are created to run the script.
In Test class, I create two @Test
The first one for comparing the Release Date where it will be failed
The second one for comparing country where it will be passed.
I used the maven build project with pom.xml where mandatory dependencies are added.
